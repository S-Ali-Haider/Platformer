# Platformer

A simple and short platformer game we made in a week for the itch.io CyberPunk Jam 2019. The objective is to make your way to the other end while fighting and dodging enemies. The enemies are based on a two-state Finite State Machine (FSM). The graphics and sounds were custom-made by us.
