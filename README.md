# Platformer

A simple and short platformer game we made in a week for the itch.io CyberPunk Jam 2019. The objective is to make your way to the other end while fighting and dodging enemies. The enemies are based on a two-state Finite State Machine (FSM). The graphics and sounds were custom-made by us.

Gameplay Instructions:

- Move with W A S D
- Jump with Space
- It is possible to jump one more time while in air
- After collecting ammo, shoot with the left-mouse click button
- Collect powerups for temporarily boosts:
  * Ammo powerup grants a single bullet
  * Speed powerup grants temporariy speed boost
  * High jump powerup temporarily makes you jump higher
  * Invulnerabilty powerup makes you immortal for a short period of time

- Jumping on an enemy's head would always kill them while shooting a biker would stun them and shooting an archer would kill them.
